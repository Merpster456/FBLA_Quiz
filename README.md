## Getting Started

#### To make running the file easier, you need to clone the repository over the command line

To do this follow these steps:

1. Open spotlight search by either pressing âŒ˜ + spacebar or clicking the magnifying glass in the top right of your screen.
2. Then procede to type 'terminal' then press enter.
3. Afterwards a small window should pop up and give you the ability to type into it. Once the window is present type the commands below and press enter.

```
git clone https://github.com/merpster456/FBLA_Quiz.git FBLA_Quiz-master
```
After the download has completed leave the terminal window open and proceed to Mac Start.

### Mac Start

To run the program on a mac is very simple. All you need is to run a few commands on your terminal. 

> NOTE: This setup used to be much easier however, due to a new mac update a couple additional steps had to be added.

If you are more experienced with command line, all you need to do is: cd into the project directory, use chmod to give the mac_start.command file permission to execute, then run it.

If you are not experienced with command line thats completely fine, just follow these steps.

1. Move into the project folder by typing the command below then click enter.

```
cd FBLA_Quiz-master
```

2. Then you need to give the program permission to execute by running the following command.
```
sudo chmod u+x mac_start.command
```
>This command will prompt you for your password. Type in the administrator password for the computer and press enter. This command is giving the program the right to run on your computer.

3. Finally start the program with one last command.
```
./mac_start.command
```
